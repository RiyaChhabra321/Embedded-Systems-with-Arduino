# Embedded-Systems-with-Arduino

This repository contains my hands-on work and practice files after completing a **Beginner Embedded Systems course by GeeksforGeeks**.

The course focused on building a strong foundation in **embedded systems using Arduino**, covering both **hardware interfacing** and **embedded programming** concepts.

## 📘 What this repository includes
- Component-wise Arduino programs
- Basic hardware interfacing examples
- Simple and beginner-friendly code
- Step-by-step learning through individual components

## 🔧 Components Covered
- LED  
- Push Button  
- Buzzer  
- LCD (16x2)  
- Keypad  
- Sensors and basic modules  

Each component is organized in a **separate folder** with its corresponding Arduino code to clearly demonstrate its working and connections.

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Arduino programming using Embedded C/C++
- Understanding pin configurations and circuit connections
- Interfacing individual components with Arduino
- Debugging basic hardware and code-level issues

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A learning reference for beginners in embedded systems
- A practical showcase of Arduino component interfacing
- A foundation for building mini-projects in the future

📌 *All programs are beginner-level and created as part of structured learning and practice.*
